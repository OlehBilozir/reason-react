# Reason React Website

This code is used to generate [https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react). It pulls in files from `../docs` and the current directory to generate the final static html files that's served on the site.

## Translations

The entire site can be translated via the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/reason-react). This repo only has the canonical english documentation. If you add new strings to this directory, please run `yarn write-translations`/`npm run write-translations`.

## Building and Deploying
*TODO*
Ping @rickyvetter if you'd like to try it eagerly.
