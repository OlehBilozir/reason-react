React on Reason
===

Scope
---
- Create bindings to React that are more native to Reason
- Implementing a reconciler that demonstrates that these bindings to React are sound
- Pure logic 
- Not UI related
- A reactive tree that changes over time

How is this related to [Reason-React](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react)?
---
This repo is for contributors to brainstorm on the next version of Reason-React in an open manner. If you're a consumer of Reason-React, please do use the existing bindings; when things are ready, we'll provide a good migration path. We care about interop and stability.

Building
---
Warning: There's currently no examples that are built. This will be made to
work in the future.

```sh
npm install
npm run 
npm run build
# to clean: npm run clean 
```
